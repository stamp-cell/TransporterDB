TransporterDB is a biophysical database that contains data on the kinetic parameters of membrane transporters and ion channels.
TransporterDB can be accessed through a web browser (https://transporterdb.org/) and GitHub repository
(https://github.com/stamp-cell/TransporterDB). 
Equations for the parameters were taken from a comprehensive mathematical toolkit based on a collection of over 200 sources.
The source of the equations are from [A mathematical modeling toolbox for ion channels and transporters across cell membranes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0017931021005263)

While TransporterDB has not been fully completed, it contains information on more than 80 models of human ion channels and membrane transporters. 
The source of data is in vivo and in vitro studies on different mammals. Users and readers are encouraged to submit additional data and information.

TransporterDB is developed by Shadi Zaheri, Purav Kumar Maheshwari, and Fatemeh Hassanipour.
This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant number 1454334
